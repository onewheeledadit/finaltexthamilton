of essays defending the new United States Constitution entitled The Federalist Papers The plan was to write a total of twentyfive essays the work divided evenly among the three men In the end they wrote eightyfive essays in the span of six months John Jay got sick after writing five James Madison wrote twentynine Hamilton wrote the other fiftyone How do you write like you’re Running out of time

down the river Did Washington know about the dinner Was there Presidential pressure to deliver Or did you know even then it doesn’t matter Where you put the You got more than you gave Hold your nose

with such rigor Confession time Here’s what They won’t teach you this in your classes But look it up Hamilton was wearing his glasses Why If not to take deadly aim It’s him or me the world will never be the same Look him in the eye aim no higher Summon all the courage you require Then count Wait Somebody tells me “You’d better hide” They say Were both at his side when he died Death doesn’t
